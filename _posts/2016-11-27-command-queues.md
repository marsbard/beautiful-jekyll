Found a couple of interesting 'queue' type projects

* [[https://github.com/TomAnthony/queue]] - have one terminal waiting for commands in another to complete before continuing
* [[https://github.com/chneukirchen/nq]] - no matter how many times you call a thing (e.g. transcode a video?) only one gets run at a time... :-)
