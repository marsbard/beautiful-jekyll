Found a couple of interesting 'queue' type projects

* [queue](https://github.com/TomAnthony/queue) - have one terminal waiting for commands in another to complete before continuing
* [nq](https://github.com/chneukirchen/nq) - no matter how many times you call a thing (e.g. transcode a video?) only one gets run at a time... :-)
